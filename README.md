# üé∏ Live Tonation Classification

**Live Tonation Classification** is a real-time key (tonality) detection system for musical audio, designed for musicians, music technologists, and audio hackers. It analyzes live audio input (e.g., from a guitar, keyboard, or microphone), detects the dominant notes, and predicts the musical key (major/minor) on the fly. The project features a modern Tkinter GUI for instant feedback and is built with modular, readable Python code.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time audio streaming and processing
- Automatic key (tonality) detection (major/minor)
- Live note histogram for visualization and debugging
- Tkinter GUI for easy use and instant feedback
- Modular codebase: easy to extend, hack, or integrate
- Customizable detection window and analysis interval
- Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/liveTonationClassification.git
    cd liveTonationClassification
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy sounddevice
    ```
    *(You may also need `tkinter`, which is included with most Python installations.)*

## üéπ Usage

### Run the GUI application

```bash
python main.py
```

- Click **Start Detection** to begin analyzing audio from your default input device (microphone, audio interface, etc.).
- The detected key and mode will update live in the window.
- Click **Stop Detection** to end the session.

### Run from terminal (no GUI)

```bash
python audio/stream.py
```

## üß† How it works

- Audio is streamed from your input device and split into frames.
- Pitch detection is performed on each frame using FFT.
- Detected notes are mapped to a histogram (C, C#, D, ..., B).
- Key classification uses custom templates for major/minor keys and a sliding window for robust detection.
- Results are displayed live in the GUI.

## üé∏ Example Use Cases

- Practice tool for musicians to check if they're staying in key
- Live music analysis for jam sessions or improvisation
- Educational tool for music theory classes
- Audio research and prototyping

## üìù TODO / Ideas

- [ ] Add chord detection
- [ ] Visualize note histogram in the GUI
- [ ] Support for multiple audio input devices
- [ ] Export analysis results to file
- [ ] Add support for more scales/modes
